# Fleetwood Park Vex

This repository holds the work I did before for the Fleetwood Park Vex team. It also includes videos I found helpful to learn RobotC. 

## RobotC or EasyC
RobotC is much better than EasyC. RobotC is more diffucult to learn because it teaches you programming not how to use a that specific program. Also, all the project are saved in one .c file format that can be opened in any text editor (notepad, vim, emacs, sublime text, etc.). EasyC uses this proprietary format and has multiple files for one project. All of the files in this repository are made in robotC.

"But I dont have enough time to 'actually learn programming'":
Dont program. Use jumpers instead. If you don't have enough time to learn programming then you'll probably not have enough time to program autonomous. Use jumpers and follow the vex manual to see where to plug in motors so that the preloaded program recognizes all your motors.
