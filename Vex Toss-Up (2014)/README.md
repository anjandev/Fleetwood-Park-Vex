## README

These projects must be opened in EasyC. We did not have RobotC at the time. Download the zip of this repository, unzip it, and open "1.1 Final Build Basic.ECPX" in the "1.1 Final Build Basic" folder with the open project function in EasyC. 

I had to write different pieces of code depending on where my team started. Forks of my latest version (1.1) depend on where I started and are stored in the "Situational Compiles of Source" folder.

Before we began, we drew a rough idea of what we wanted the robot to do. It is good programming practice to write lots of comments and plan out what you want the robot to do before you start programming.
