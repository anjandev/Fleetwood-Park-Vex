These projects must be opened in EasyC. We did not have RobotC at the time. Download the zip of this repository, unzip it, and open "1.1 Final Build Basic.ECPX" in the "1.1 Final Build Basic" folder with the open project function in EasyC. I had to write different pieces of code depending on where my team started. Forks of my latest version (1.1) depend on where I started and are stored in the "Situational Compiles of Source" folder.
